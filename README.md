# Landcover Classification

Satellite data can be used to estimate the type of landcover at locations around the world. This approach can be an time and cost effective alternative to manually inspecting these locations in person. In this report, we will explore a data set containing satellite data and manually labeled landcover types for locations in Benin. We will use this data to build a model that predicts the landcover type at a location based on the satellite data.

**Landcover types:**

1. *Built-up:* Built-up areas, also known as urban areas, are regions where the landscape is dominated by human-made structures such as buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. These areas are characterized by high-density development and are typically associated with cities, towns, and other developed communities. Built-up areas include residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional land uses.

2. *Cropland:* Cropland refers to land that is used for the cultivation of crops. This landcover type includes fields used for growing a variety of crops such as grains, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural products. Cropland can vary in size from small family farms to large-scale industrial agricultural operations.

3. *Natural Forest:* Natural forests are areas covered by trees and other vegetation that have developed through natural processes without significant human intervention. These forests play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, regulating climate, and providing habitat for wildlife. Natural forests can be found in a variety of climatic zones, from tropical rainforests to temperate and boreal forests.

4. *Orchard:* An orchard is a type of agricultural land where trees or shrubs are cultivated primarily for fruit production. Orchards are typically designed for intensive farming practices, focusing on high yields of specific fruit species such as apples, oranges, cherries, and nuts. These areas require careful management and maintenance to ensure healthy tree growth and abundant fruit production.
